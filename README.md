A very basic MP3 play I made while trying to learn C#. 
I followed the tutorial [here.](https://www.caveofprogramming.com/c-sharp-tutorial/c-for-beginners-make-your-own-mp3-player-free.html)

# Instructions
[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kk5vcjro6b6yfe7/MyMP3.application?dl=0) and open it.
Click "open" and select a song.
