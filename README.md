# MyMP3
A very basic MP3 player I made while trying to learn C#. 
I followed the tutorial [here.](https://www.caveofprogramming.com/c-sharp-tutorial/c-for-beginners-make-your-own-mp3-player-free.html)

# Instructions
[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vadu5g9jewxfr34/AAAR9_BgvA9fmhR40Re5Sybva?dl=0) and open it.
Click "open" and select a song.
I have not been able to get it to work on any computer besides mine, but it works on my computer, and in the end, that's all that really matters.
